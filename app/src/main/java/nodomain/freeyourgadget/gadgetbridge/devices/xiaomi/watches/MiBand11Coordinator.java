 * Xiaomi Smart Band 11.
 *
 * <p>Built on top of {@link MiBand10Coordinator}, which is the closest known relative.
 * The band advertises itself as {@code Xiaomi Smart Band 11 XXXX} — exactly the same
 * naming scheme as the band 10 — and belongs to the same Xiaomi protobuf device family,
 * so only the advertised-name pattern has to differ.
 *
 * <p>Observed advertisement (MiBeacon service data {@code 0xFE95}):
 * <pre>
 *   frame control : 0x5917   (v5, mac + capability + event + mesh)
 *   product id    : 0x8812
 *   name          : "Xiaomi Smart Band 11 5B38"
